Dear Dr. \${1:rDVM},

I saw '\${2:Patient Name}' -- a \${3:Signalment} with a history of miotic pupil \${4|OS,OD|} for \${5:Time Frame} duration.

On exam today I noted intact menaces and PLRs OU. The \${6|right,left|} eye is within normal limits. The \${7|right,left|} eye was noted to have a miotic pupil, enophthalmia with elevation of the third eyelid, and some ptosis as well. I checked for uveitis and ulceration and found no signs of either. The remainder of the exam was within normal limits.

Given the clinical signs, I suspect that \${2:Patient name} has Horner's syndrome and discussed the disease with the owner. Since the condition is relatively acute, we did not phenylephrine test as it takes a little bit of time to get the delayed hypersensitivity reaction to confirm post-ganglionic Horner's. We discussed diagnostic testing including chest radiographs but the owner elected to monitor for now.

Our plan is to monitor at home with the hopes that the signs will gradually improve over the next 3-6 months. We do not need to see \${2:Patient name} back unless clinical signs persist or worsen.

Thanks again for sharing this case with me, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns!

Best wishes,
Thomas Chen DVM, MS, DACVO
