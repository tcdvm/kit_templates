Dear Dr. \${1:rDVM},

I saw '\${2:Patient Name}' -- a \${3:Signalment} with a history of nonhealing corneal ulcer \${4|OS,OD|} for \${5:Time Frame} duration.

On exam today I noted intact menaces and PLRs OU. The \${6|right,left|} eye is clear except for normal aging changes. The \${7|right,left|} eye has a superficial corneal ulcer with nonadherent epithelial margins which stain was noted to extend under. The remainder of the exam was within normal limits.

I recommended and the owner agreed to a CTA and diamond burr debridement which we did with topical anesthetic. I removed approximately \${8:Percent Debrided}% of the corneal epithelium. I also placed a bandage contact lens and recommended to the owner that $2 continue to wear a cone at all time. In addition, they were told that the procedure is about 80% successful but the remaining 20% or so may require more debridements if healing does not occur.

Our plan is to continue with topical antibiotics and oral pain medications . We would like to see \${2:Patient name} back in approximately 2 weeks for recheck of the corneal ulcer.

Thanks again for sharing this case with me, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns!

Best wishes,
Thomas Chen DVM, MS, DACVO
