Dear Dr. \${1:rDVM},

I saw '\${2:Patient Name}' -- a \${3:Signalment} with a history of diabetes and vision loss.

On exam today I noted absent menaces but intact PLRs OU. Both eyes have symmetrical findings - namely mature cataracts but no signs of active uveitis. I spoke to the owner about cataract surgery (provided the diabetes is controlled) and that the next steps would be to move forward with an ERG & Ultrasound. Hopefully they will schedule and we can go forward with cataract removal.

Our plan is \${6:to start topical NSAIDs} and we will wait to hear from them to schedule further diagnostics.

Thanks again for sharing this case with me, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns!

Best wishes,
Thomas Chen DVM, MS, DACVO
