Dear Dr. \${1},

I saw '\${2}' -- a \${3} with a history of suspect cataracts and vision loss \${4}.

On exam today I noted absent menaces but intact PLRs OU. Both eyes have symmetrical findings - namely mature cataracts but no signs of active uveitis. I spoke to the owner about cataract surgery and that the next steps would be to move forward with an ERG & Ultrasound. They will discuss it at home with their family and if interested will schedule diagnostics and we can move forward with cataract removal if the results are acceptable.

Our plan is \$6 and we will wait to hear from them to schedule further diagnostics.

Thanks again for sharing this case with me, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns!

Best wishes,
Thomas Chen DVM, MS, DACVO
