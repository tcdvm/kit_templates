Dear Dr. \${1:rDVM},

I saw '\${2:Patient Name}' -- a \${3:Signalment} with a history of nonhealing corneal ulcer \${4|OS,OD|} for \${5:Time Frame} duration.

On exam today I noted intact menaces and PLRs OU. The \${6|right,left|} eye is clear except for normal aging changes. The \${7|right,left|} eye has a superficial corneal ulcer with nonadherent epithelial margins which stain was noted to extend under. The remainder of the exam was within normal limits.

I discussed with the owner about doing a CTA (50% healing rate) or diamond burr debridement (80% healing rate). They elected for the former which we did with topical anesthetic. I enlarged the original ulcer by approximately \${8:Percent Debrided}%. We recommended to the owner that $2 continue to wear a cone at all time. If the ulcer does NOT heal, then our plan is to follow up with the diamond burr.

We will continue with topical antibiotics and oral pain medications and would like to see \${2:Patient name} back in approximately 2-3 weeks for recheck of the corneal ulcer.

Thanks again for sharing this case with me, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns!

Best wishes,
Thomas Chen DVM, MS, DACVO
