The right and left eyelid region was clipped and prepped with dilute baby shampoo (1:5) and povidone iodine solution (1:50).  An elliptical portion of skin was excised adjacent to the affected lid margin.  A small portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle was also removed.  Wound closure consisted of simple interrupted sutures using 5-0 Nylon. Recovery from anesthesia was routine.
